        <p>Team members: Chelsee Dickson, Carole English, Alicia Estabrook, 
			Alejandro Sanchez (team lead), and Nasiya Sharif.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to measure the impact of a country’s food security 
        level on secondary school enrollment and the generation of income through the 
        education channel.</p>
        <p>We aim to:</p>
        	<ul>
				<li>Visualize food security and secondary school enrollment world wide</li>
				<li>Simulate the economic impact of changes in a country’s food security 
				level through the education channel</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Our project advances an interactive web-based tool that allows a user to 
		click on a country to get information about its policy strengths and weaknesses 
		from the perspective of a social market economy. The user can then simulate policy 
		changes and see how this policy change changes the economic growth trajectory. 
		Results will be presented through visualizations, and data have been prepared by the Project Owner. </p>
